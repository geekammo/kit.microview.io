## Meet our Breadboard

In this set of tutorials we're going to use a solderless breadboard as the prototyping base for the circuits we build.

The breadboard included within the MicroView Learning Kit is the "[Breadboard - Self-Adhesive (White)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12002)" from SparkFun Electronics. 

## How it's all connected
The main area of our breadboard is comprised of rows and columns. Coloumns `A` through to `J`, and rows `1` through to `30`.

The power and ground rails of the left and right hand sizes of the breadboard (denoted by the red and black lines) are not lettered or numbered. In the course we're going to copy what (the breadboard prototyping software) [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) does and refer to these columns as `W`, `X`, `Y` and `Z`.

Fritzing has uses a weird numbering scheme for the ower and ground rails, but it doesn't really matter as both the power and ground rails are vertically connected.
