intro: |
  In this circuit you’ll work with a potentiometer.
  A potentiometer is also known as a variable resistor. When it’s connected with 5 volts across its two outer pins, the middle pin outputs a voltage between 0 and 5, depending on the position of the knob on the potentiometer. A potentiometer is a perfect demonstration of a variable voltage divider circuit. The voltage is divided proportionate to the resistance between the middle pin and the ground pin. In this circuit, you’ll learn how to use a potentiometer and display it's value on the MicroView.


what_you_should_see: |
  
  As you move a blunt long object (like the one shown below) up and down the soft potentiometer, the MicroView Slider Widget should change it's value accordingly.

  If it isn't working, make sure you have assembled the circuit correctly and verified and uploaded the code to your MicroView, or see the troubleshooting tips below.

  <strong>Warning:</strong>

  Do not use your thumb or fingers to slide the softpot as you could short the circuit and potentially burn!

  **Bizarre Results**

  The most likely cause of this is if you’re pressing the potentiometer in more than one position. This is normal and can actually be used to create some neat results.
