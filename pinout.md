## Mapping Arduino Pins to the MicroView

The MicroView has 16 "physical pins" that map to corresponding "Arduino pins" that can be referenced from within your Arduino sketch. For example, Physical `Pin2` maps to the Arduino's pin `A5` (analog pin 5).

The pin numbering for the MicroView increments as you move anti-clockwise.

The MicroView's physical `Pin1` is denoted by a dot on the underside of the MicroView.
